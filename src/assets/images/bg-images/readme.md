# About this Folder

- Generally, this folder should be a temp folder as all background images should come from WordPress.
- All files should end in .png or .jpg.
- Production images (not served by WordPress) should end in .webp
- All files should be called with inline html / php and _not_ with CSS (see `k1_get_image_asset_url` function in `inc/theme-functions`)
